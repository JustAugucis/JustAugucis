"Space_bar.txt" is for defining space bar
"Next_Letter.txt" is for defining how letters are going to be spaced apart
"Encryption.txt" is for storing encryption method
"Input.txt" is what you input
"Output.txt" is the output you get based on function


By default this is made for morse code to binary translation but by changing "Encryption.txt" it
can be used for anything.
